# coilgun

A coil gun is like a railgun, but different. In my opinion it is better as there is no sliding electrical contacts (which means lots of friciton).

* **README.md** is this text you are reading right now.
* **coil.py** is the code for the coil gun that uses the sensors (which don't work).
* **pinRead.py** is some code I wrote to debug stuff. It displays the signals being recieved from each input.
* **prS.py** is some more code I wrote to debug stuff. It does the exact same thing as pinRead.py, but is more sensitive.
* **tcoil.py** is the code for the coil gun that keeps each solenoid on for a certian amount of time.
